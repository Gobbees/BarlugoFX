### A universal photo editor that allows you to make your photos look better than ever.

## Getting Started

You can download the [latest available release](https://github.com/Gobbees/BarlugoFX/releases) (we suggest the JAR version)

### Prerequisites
* **JRE or JDK** (8 and above) (you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html))
* **OpenJFX** (if JRE is Oracle >= 9 or Open)  (you can download it from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/))
* **JUnit** (you can download it from [here](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/releases/tag/r5.4.2))

In order to use BarlugoFX with bigger images, we higly suggest launching it with the command

**java -XmxNg BarlugoFX**

Where N is the number of Gigabytes you want to allocate for the program. We highly suggest to use at least 4Gb of ram for the program to function properly on big images (4K and over). 


#### Have fun using it!
